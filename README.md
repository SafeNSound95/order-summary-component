## Overview

This is my fourth challenge on the frontend mentor website, the task is to build an order summary component. This one is a bit more challenging layout wise; some indivisual mini components have an interesting and challenging layout to apply.

## My process

As per usual, grid for the overall layout, flexbox for the layout of the smaller components.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Did some interesting things with the grid children, using align-self: start for one, and align-self:end on the other to get them to kind of get "hooked" to each other, so that was really cool, and gave me a moment of pause when I made it happen.

- Had to learn more about the background property and its many values, it was challenging to get the two backgrounds to mesh with each other.

- In general, more practice with Flexbox and Grid is always welcome, I feel like I'm only tapping the potential of what they could really do and it's fascinating really! and I can't wait to practice more of these two.

### Continued development

Play with the background property and its related values A LOT more! it's gonna be both challenging and fun, but I'm sure there are many cool things that can be done with the background property and intend to uncover some.
